# Welcome to my Assortment of Obfuscated Code
Be forewarned, this repository contains snippets of "graphic" code; look away if you cannot stand the sight of mutilated and/or disfigured code.

That being said, enjoy your stay. This README contains what I have on here so far (though I have been obfuscating recreationally for about as long as I've been programming, thanks JavaScript!). Click the link to navigate to the folder with the code, which contains a more detailed README as well as execution instructions.

## [Tic Tac Toe](./TicTacToe/) in Python ***and*** Ruby
Consisting of two programs, an interactive Tic Tac Toe interface written in Python, and a Ruby driver that furnishes the game with a perfect AI. The second program was written in response to a challenge I received from [Benny Blue](https://benny.blue/) after he saw the first one.

## [Game of Life](./GameOfLife) in Java

Java does not let you get away with much, certainly not as much as JavaScript might. So, I thought the best way to deface this language was to be as obtuse as possible and do calculations using as much [Peano Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms) as I possibly could. Furthermore, all the variable names consist exclusively of `$` and `_`. It's really quite beautiful if you think about it.
